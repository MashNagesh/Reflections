When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local? I would prefer a remote repository 
	whenever Iam going to collaborate with multiple users who will have access to whatever Iam doing and also when iam pretty sure about what iam adding 
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  When you are working upon something different and you want to see it work on the current settings and not want to distub it with any other modifications form other users
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
 Fork - Github Remote user repository to your repository
 Clone - is like dowloading a repository onto your local computer 
 Branch - creating a spin off from your master for a different purpose

 What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
  If you are goign offline this could be useful since you can add in your changes on top of that and then later merge back with minimal resolutions

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
	We might have to coordinate with the collaborator over phone or e-mail them frequently so that the versions remain correct.This is harder but more personal and some double work could be avoided.
When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
  When we have multiple people working upon the same master it is appropriate to work on a separate branch and then ask for a merge request since pushing the same without intimating might cause confusion and later debugging problems
